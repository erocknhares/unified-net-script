# unified-net-script
Here is where we maintain the Unified Net Script.
The Unified Net Script is an effort to collapse the traditional net script into a document that can handle calls for both voice and digital training, i.e., "[Training--Voice]" and "[Training--Digital]" smoothly.
See project unified net script.
